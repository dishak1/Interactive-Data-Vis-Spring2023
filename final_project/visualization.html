        <b>Interpretation: </b>From the above graph, we can conclude that most of the women who gave birth were in between 20-34 years of age. What surprised me was the teen pregnancy, because I thought Texas might have the highest rate of teen pregnancy and this graph does not depict the same thing. Infact, Maine has the highest pregnancy rate with 26.0 births per 1000 women. This graph also potrays that women do prefer to get pregnant after the age of 35. According to me, the census data is either incomplete or it is not showing the right data. The reseaon behind this is that there is no teenage pregnacy (age 15-19) in Vermont and District of Columbia, and states such as, Washington and Nebraska has a very low rate for teenage pregnancy. Either these states' women are doing great job in not getting pregnant at such young age, or that particular state just do not want to share such sensitive data.

        <b>Interpretation: </b>From the above graph, we can conclude that United States has a very mixed population when it comes to the Education factor. Most of the states have alot of womens holding more than a high school degree. We can see that North Dakota tops the list. However, the fact that was mentioned in the information section, regarding the correlation between higher education and pregnancy rate, does not reflect completely in this graph. By comparing the two graphs, we can visualize that the rate of women holding post graduate degree is higher that the women under the age group of 35-50. This means that women are getting pregnant before they attain post-graduate degrees. In other words, women do choose to study after having a baby. Apart from this, we can see that most of the women who got pregnant in their teenage, does not study further.

      <b class="p2">Reflection:</b>I want to reflect on certain things that I noticed about the Census Data. I created two stacked bar graphs so that I can compare if the information would match and correlate with each other. However, I see some cracks in the dataset. Firstly, the top graph shows that District of Columbia does not have any teen pregnancy and in the bottom graph, District of Columbia tops the chart with highest rate of women with an education of High School or less. Either District of Columbia is not providing an accurate data or their women does not study above the High School Degree and choose to wait till they get 20 years of old to be pregnant (which does not sound correct). Apart from this, it is strange to know that the stats of Census Data does not match with other government websites such as, CDC and World Population, where North Dakota does not top the chart. Census Data does not provide a proper information on their variables and how they extracted the data, which makes me wonder if the created graphs are meaningful or not. Therefore, the flaws of Census Data should make us wonder whether we should trust this dataset and rely on it to make major decision or intervention for the broader population or not.
