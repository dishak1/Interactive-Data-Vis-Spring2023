            <b>ABSTRACT:</b>
         </br>
        </br>
            The topic that I have explored is ‘Factors affecting Pregnancy Rates’. The dataset has been extracted from “Census Bureau” website and the data has been filtered out from the past 12 months of fertility data. The dataset is called “Fertility ACS: 1-year Estimates”. The dataset was in csv format and I manipulated the data using Excel. I chose to transpose my data first and removed unwanted variables and rows and columns that I was not going to use for the project. After that I decided to breakdown my dataset as per different varibale because I was having trouble selecting certain rows and columns. But, most of this manipulation was done using Excel tool. The purpose of the data is to explore various factors that could play their role in creating some relationship with the fertility variables or whether there is any similarity or difference in pattern between various states in the fertility rate aspect. The audience of my project could be anyone from a health student trying to understand the various attributes contributing to fertility rate or it could be the higher authority at decision-making positions who can use this analysis to make some intervention.
