            <b>ABSTRACT:</b>
         </br>
        </br>
            The revised tutorial is a new revised version of Section 2_1: Quantities and Amounts. This tutorial take the State and Total housing units variable from dataset'statePopulation'. It shows the available housing units across the states of America. Previously it contained a normal Horizontal Bar Graph without any additional features in it. After doing other tutorials and final project, I have implied some additional features that I have learned so far. I added sorting function to sort the bar graph alphabetically, ascending, and descending order. I added transition function as well so that the graph changes with a smooth linear transition. Apart from that I added the x-axis label and the title of the graph that I missed in my tutorial submission.
