    Definition of Pregnancy Rate:
  </p>  

  <p>
     Pregnancy rate is the total number of resident pregnancies including live births, induced abortions, and fetal deaths per 1,000 women aged 15-44 years for a specified geographical area. There is no universally accepted definition of the term. However, pregnacy rate refers to the rate of succcessful pregnacies. 
    <br/>
    For the purpose of this project, we are using the pregnancy rate for different states.

    Definition of Fertility Rate:
  </p>  

  <p>
    Fertility Rate is an estimate of the number of children a women would have if at a given age her behavior matched the average of the women at that same age. In other words, it is the number of live births born per 1000 women of chilbearing age, which is usually defined as 15 to 44 years old.

    <h1>Facts on various variables:</h1>
</div>

<div>
<p>
<b>AGE: </b>There is a significant connection between age and female fertility. Usually, a girlâ€™s first menstrual cycle occurs around the age of 12-13 (can happen early or later depending on individual) and after puberty, the fertility rate increases with a decline in later age. Therefore, with increase in maternal age, one can notice a decrease in pregnancy rate. 
</br>
</br>
<b>EDUCATION: </b> Girls who have received minimal education are 5 times more likely to become a mother than those with higher levels of education and teenage pregnancy leads to drop-out from schools. Higher education influences women's decision of bearing a child in later-age. 
</br>
</br>
With this project, I would like to explore the pattern of pregnancy rates and how the age of the women and the education level influences the pregnancy rate.
